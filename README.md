# multi-stage-malaria-classification-with-graph-ml

This project is based on a 2021 research study that was able to classify the multiple stages of the malaria parasite using transfer learning and unsupervised graph deep learning in pytorch. In this project, I built the project using tensflow, keras, and the spektral graph library while the original project used the pytorch framework and torch.nn library.
